Modern systems must handle vast transactions efficiently and ensure all components work seamlessly together.\n\nRegulation and governance also pose challenges. Balancing innovation with compliance is tricky, especially with decentralized systems that may not align with existing regulations.\n\nLastly, managing risks such as volatility and security breaches is essential to maintain stability while leveraging each system's adaptability benefits.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on how these challenges might be addressed?",
