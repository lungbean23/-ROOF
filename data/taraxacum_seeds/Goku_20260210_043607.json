Consider pilot programs to test solutions before full-scale implementation.\n\n3. **Funding Strategies**: Explore diverse funding sources such as grants, corporate partnerships, and crowd-funding to support scalability and sustainability.\n\n4. **Regulatory Navigation**: Engage with local governments and regulatory bodies to navigate legal landscapes and ensure compliance with financial technology regulations.\n\n5. **Monitoring and Evaluation**: Establish systems to measure impact and gather user feedback for continuous improvement.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, we can overcome key challenges in scaling solutions.
