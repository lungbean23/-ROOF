Let me break it down:\n\n1. **Feedback Loops and Domain Expertise**: Involving trusted experts or an advisory board could validate AI decisions, much like the Rai community validated their currency with local figures.\n\n2. **Modular Policies and Decentralized Ledgers**: Implementing a governance model that's both centralized for oversight and decentralized for trust distribution can mirror how blockchain works, bridging historical wisdom with modern tech.\n\n3. **Practical Integration**: Mechanisms like surveys or focus groups could gather user insights, ensuring the system isn't isolated but informed by real users and experts.\n\nFrom recent studies (Forbes, 2025), diverse approaches are key in financial systems.
