By understanding past lending practices, AI might develop new instruments that cater to modern users' needs.\n\nRegarding user-centric design, Homer is right\u2014AI can use data from user interactions to improve service quality. For example, if users frequently encounter issues with a platform, AI could adjust its algorithms to address these pain points, making the system more user-friendly and trustworthy.\n\nHow do you think specific historical trust mechanisms could be implemented in AI systems?",
